ChatGPT is booming over the internet and has drawn global attention since the day it was released. This invention has put a big question mark to leading AI companies.

ChatGPT is one of the most compelling language models developed by OpenAI that uses deep learning techniques to discover and generate natural language. Because of its ability to generate human-like text, this ChatGPT is turned into a useful tool for a variety of applications such as conversation, Q&A, Language Translation, Chat, Text Conclusion, and so on. There can be numerous use cases for this OpenAI ChatGPT.

In this article, we will discuss OpenAI (ChatGPT) in more detail.

## What is OpenAI?
ChatGPT is developed by OpenAI, a company. OpenAI is a research organization and technology company based in San Francisco, California. It was founded in 2015 by Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, and others. The main goal of the company is to develop and promote friendly AI in a way that benefits humanity. OpenAI is governed by the board of OpenAI nonprofit, and OpenAI LP employees. The core investors of the company are Microsoft, Reid Hoffman‚Äôs charitable foundation, and Khosla Ventures.

## What is ChatGPT?
ChatGPT is an AI chatbot which is one of the most popular products of OpenAI. This ChatGPT is a highly capable chatbot that is using GPT 3.5 (Generative Pretrained Transformer) which is beyond the language processing. It uses deep learning techniques to understand and generate natural language, making it a useful tool for a variety of applications such as language translation, text summarization, and conversation generation. <br>
One of the main attractions of ChatGPT is the capability of producing Human-text, which is a more natural language. This AI is a work of intensive research and by training the model on a massive dataset of written text that led to uncover the patterns and distinctions of human natural language. Furthermore, this achievement is well suited for the assignment like predicting the next word or phrase based on the context of the text.

Another key feature of ChatGPT is the ability to understand the context of conversation. Which means, we can ask follow-up questions and chat like humans, and you can ask anything. üôÇ

It uses RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback). It was released with a free version (preview) earlier to collect feedback and learn about its strengths and weaknesses.

However, it can‚Äôt produce video, sound or images like its brother DALL-E 2, but instead has an in-depth understanding of the spoken and written word.
